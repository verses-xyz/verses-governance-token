# Verses Governance Token

A simple mintable, pausable governance token designed to be managed by an owner address.

- Mintable: The owner may mint new tokens, up to a predefined cap.
- Pausable: The owner may pause transfers of the token.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```

This will start a local hardhat network and deploy a token to it.

Important files are contract/Token.sol, test/Token.js, and scripts/deploy.js.

## Frontend (unused)

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail.
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.
